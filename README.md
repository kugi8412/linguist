The ./linguist.sh text.txt command should print out the words occurring in the text,
along with the number of their occurrences, starting with the most frequent ones.
The script can take the -c option, in which case it should print out the letters instead of words.
The script can also take the -n number option, in which case, instead of all occurring words or characters,
it should print out no more than the specified number. Both options can be combined.
